* store additional information in matrix
** distances till next clay block
- only down
- all directions periodically, ie i % 4 == 1 stores blocks till down, i % 4 == 2 stores left, etc.
  + same idea but instead of remainders, group them in squares instead





* do it in opengl or in another graphics library
